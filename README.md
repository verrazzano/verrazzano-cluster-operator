# Verrazzano Cluster Operator

The Verrazzano Cluster Operator is an operator that interacts with Kubernetes clusters in the Verrazzano
environment and with the Rancher Server on behalf of the Verrazzano system.

The responsibilities of the Cluster Rancher Operator are the following:
- Watch the Rancher API for available clusters, and creates `VerrazzanoManagedCluster` custopm resources to define
  these for the Super Domain Operator to consume.
- Call the Rancher Catalog API to ensure things prerequisites like Prometheus Operator and Istio are installed in
  the Managed Clusters.

## Project Status

This repo is currently an ALPHA, with some details and tests stubbed out.  What it currently does:
- Sets up informers on k8s secrets and `VerrazzanoManagedClusters` - these are the k8s entities that Verrazzano Rancher Operator interacts with.
- Stubbed out calls to create/update secrets and `VerrazzanoManagedClusters`.
- Stubbed out section to poll Rancher server to discover available clusters.
- Stubbed out section to install prerequisites like Prometheus Operator and Istio.
- Stubbed out integ tests, and no unit tests yet.

kubectl apply -f ./k8s/manifests/verrazzano-cluster-operator-deployment.yaml
```

**Note** If you want to use your own Docker image, update the image in the
`verrazzano-cluster-operator-deployment.yaml` file first.
